## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Subtitle Delay / Offset (closes #4)**: Shift subtitle timing relative to video — `subtitledelay` attribute, `subtitleDelay` property, `setSubtitleDelay()` / `getSubtitleDelay()` API methods, and a new `subtitledelaychange` CustomEvent. Sign convention matches VLC/mpv (positive = subtitles later). UI cap ±300s with widened input. Z/X hotkeys nudge by 100ms per press; OSD shows the current offset. Auto-prefetch when delay becomes non-zero so negative offsets work (cues from stream positions ahead of the demuxer cursor). Applied at the renderer's active-cue check so a single offset works for text and image (PGS/DVB) cues without re-decoding.
- **Subtitle Customization Panel**: `subtitlesize`, `subtitlecolor`, `subtitlebg`, `subtitleedge` attributes, plus an in-player customize panel persisted to localStorage. Size multiplier drives both bitmap (PGS/VOBSUB) and text (SRT/ASS/VTT) cues; edge style applies to text subs.
- **Subtitle Transcript Browser**: Full-cover panel with search, click-to-seek, active-cue highlight, italic/bold/entity rendering, and delay-aware timestamps. Click on a live caption opens the transcript at the current cue. Backed by a native `movi_prefetch_subtitle_cues` that uses `AVDISCARD_ALL` so a 700 MB scan touches only subtitle packets, not every audio/video body.
- **Karaoke Captions for VTT**: Tag-only-token folding, min-width anchor measured offscreen, render-key cache to stop the 60fps `innerHTML` rewrite that prevented fade-in during playback. Format-aware backdrop (VTT-only).
- **Premuxed Quality Menu**: Multiple `<source data-height="...">` children give a YouTube-style quality picker for plain MP4/MKV files — no HLS manifest needed. Adopt/release native `<audio>` across switches preserves the user-activation token so the next switch isn't blocked by autoplay policy.
- **Multi-Language Audio via `<source kind="audio">`**: Two or more audio `<source>` tags with `srclang` (or `label`) become parallel language tracks; the player surfaces the audio-language menu and `getAudioLangs()` / `selectAudioLang()` work exactly as for muxed tracks. Default pick: explicit `default` / `data-default` → first locale match (`navigator.language` prefix) → first track. Single `<source kind="audio">` continues to use the legacy split-audio path.
- **External Subtitles via `<track>`**: Standard `<video>`-style declarative markup — `<track kind="subtitles">`, `kind="captions"`, or no `kind` are recognized. Reads `srclang`, `label`, and `data-format` (defaults to VTT, set `srt` for SRT sidecars). Lets integrators ship full caption configurations as plain HTML without wiring up `source({ subtitles: [...] })` from JS.
- **Host Fullscreen Handoff**: New cancelable `movi-fullscreen-request` CustomEvent + `setHostFullscreen(active)` method. Lets embedders (VS Code webviews, custom app shells) take over fullscreen with their own chrome while keeping the player's toolbar icon, OSD, and context-menu label in sync. Fullscreen state is now reflected in the context-menu label.
- **File Revoked Event**: `filerevoked` CustomEvent fires when the browser silently revokes a `File` handle (mobile background / memory pressure). `FileSource` races each chunk read against an 8s timeout — no more demuxer hanging forever — and surfaces the failure via a one-shot `onRevoked` callback on `MoviPlayer`.
- **`MoviPlayer.hasAudibleSource()`**: Unified gate covering muxed audio, split native `<audio>`, *and* HLS audio (which lives inside the hidden native `<video>`). Used internally to decide whether to show volume controls / accept volume hotkeys.
- **VS Code Extension**: New `vscode-extension/` package (Marketplace 0.2.5). Webview-hosted player registered as a CustomEditor — single-click opens any MP4/MKV/HEVC/AV1/WebM/MOV/TS file VS Code can't natively play. True streaming via a custom `DataSource` (webview's `File` proxy delegates `slice().arrayBuffer()` to extension-host `fs.createReadStream` chunks); memory cost drops from O(filesize) to ~chunk size, so multi-GB and 8K HDR files no longer hit the 4 GB Blob limit. Movi fullscreen toggle hides workbench chrome with auto-cleanup on crash. OS wake lock (`caffeinate -i` / `systemd-inhibit` / `SetThreadExecutionState`) held during fullscreen. Multi-window playback via `movi.openInNewWindow`. Output channel surfaces bundled-player logs.
- **Web App Explorer-Style Playlist**: Folder hierarchy tree with collapsible groups + guide rail, multi-select, live search (folders auto-expand on match), keyboard navigation (Tab toggle, Up/Down/Enter, Esc). Thumbnails + metadata cached in IndexedDB so reopening the same files skips every WASM call. SEO overhaul, landing animations, gradient circle brand mark.
- **Chrome Extension Explorer Playlist**: Folder tree, breadcrumb, badges, progress, drag/drop, multi-file + folder picking. Shared isolated WASM instance (2-instance budget) for thumbnail generation, cached in IndexedDB across sessions. Install detection on moviplayer.com hides the "Add to Chrome" prompt when the extension is already present. Gradient circle play-button branding to match the main app.
- **Stats 8K / 16K Tiers**: `4320p` (8K) and `8640p` (16K) labels in both native and HLS stats paths — previously bucketed as 4K.

### Changed
- **HLS Volume Controls Now Visible**: Volume button, `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` hotkeys, and volume OSD were gated only on muxed/split audio, so HLS streams (audio inside the native `<video>`) had no mute control. Consolidated behind `hasAudibleSource()` so the HLS path is covered too.
- **Audio Decode Stays Running While Muted**: The demux loop no longer drops audio packets when muted — `AudioRenderer` keeps gain at 0 instead. Fixes the "atak atak" judder on unmute, where the audio clock pivoted forward to the demuxer's lookahead (~1–3s ahead of presentation) and `CanvasRenderer` chased it 25%/frame.
- **Bluetooth A2DP Keepalive**: Pause path now suspends the AudioContext but starts a near-silent looping `<audio>` element so the OS audio session stays claimed. BT devices stop dropping/re-pairing on every pause without re-introducing the "2–3s jump-ahead on resume" regression.
- **DPR-Scaled Canvas Backbuffer**: Canvas backbuffer scales with `devicePixelRatio` (capped at 2×) so downsampling 4K/8K sources stays sharp. CSS dimensions remain in logical pixels.
- **Encrypted Source Static Import**: `EncryptedHttpSource` hoisted to a top-level import — no more async boundary on every encrypted load. Matches the other source adapters.
- **FFmpeg Bumped to n8.1.1**: Picks up upstream point-release fixes on the n8.1 branch. `dvbsubtitle` / `dvdsubtitle` decoders renamed to `dvbsub` / `dvdsub` to match.
- **Subtitle Default Sizing**: Bumped the text-subtitle base size and replaced the desktop-era 60px floor on bottom padding with a height-proportional 8% (24px floor) so subtitles don't crowd into the middle of small embeds.
- **Menu Animations**: Pop-in / pop-out on the audio, subtitle, quality, and speed dropdowns plus a fade between the customize panel and track list. Bottom-controls dropdowns enforce one-at-a-time. Click on the player area closes any open menu instead of toggling play/pause.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Ignored While Typing in Inputs**: Hotkeys no longer fire when an input/textarea inside the shadow DOM is focused.
- **Audio Menu Always Shows Language Code**: `formatAudioBadge` previously dropped the language code when channel info was available, so muxed tracks from MKV/MP4 displayed only "AAC Stereo" with no way to tell languages apart.
- **COOP/COEP Hard-Required**: README/docs corrected — the player hard-blocks without `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. Surfaces a "Security Headers Missing" diagnostic instead of a cryptic timeout. Mention `coi-serviceworker` as a static-host workaround.

### Fixed
- **~1s Fullscreen Freeze**: ResizeObserver fires repeatedly during the fullscreen animation. Each call set `canvas.width` twice (in `updateCanvasSize` and `CanvasRenderer.resize`), clearing the WebGL framebuffer on every burst. Coalesced same-size resizes, dropped the duplicate width/height assignment, dropped the `<video>.width/height` no-ops.
- **WebGL Context Loss Recovery (Mobile)**: Capture canvas to JPEG on `visibilitychange→hidden` while the GL context is alive; on return, hide instantly if `gl.isContextLost()` is false, otherwise leave it up so `handleContextLost`/`handleContextRestored` can run recovery without a corrupt framebuffer flashing through. Restored `isLoading` clear so `initializePlayer` doesn't early-return after long minimize. 5s cooldown between audio-resync seeks prevents stutter loops on slow software audio decoders.
- **HLS First-Frame Black**: Manifests without `RESOLUTION` caused `configure(0,0)` on the canvas renderer, producing a black frame that only cleared on the next ResizeObserver tick. Defer configure to `<video> loadedmetadata` when manifest dims are missing.
- **HLS Quality Badge / Fit Animation**: Re-emit `tracksChange` on `LEVEL_SWITCHED` so the gear badge reflects the active rendition in Auto mode. Skip smoothing-state reset on same-size canvas resizes so fit-mode toggles can lerp instead of snapping; clone last frame in the direct-render path so HLS paused redraws have a source to animate against.
- **Pause→Resume 2–3s Jump-Ahead**: Pause now preserves scheduled buffers and sync anchors exactly, so the first packet drained from `pendingPrebufferPackets` (whose timestamp is the demuxer's lookahead) doesn't become the new `firstBufferMediaTime` anchor on resume.
- **Aspect-Ratio Change While Paused**: Fit-mode change now repaints the canvas after a seek-to-paused and animates via a dedicated RAF loop instead of snapping. Poster overlay tracks the active fit mode, lets pointer events pass through so dblclick / gesture handlers still fire, and stays hidden until a source is set.
- **Mobile Speaker Tap**: Switched from `PointerEvent.pointerType` (Android Chrome synthesizes click with `pointerType="mouse"` from a touch tap) to `matchMedia("(hover: none)")` as the primary touch signal. `composedPath()` to cross shadow boundary in the close-volume listener. Mobile media query no longer hides the slider on `.active`.
- **Embed Security Headers Diagnostic**: Every `src=` change now re-runs `checkSecurityHeaders()`, so reused players surface "Security Headers Missing" instead of a cryptic "Failed to open media: Timeout at 0".
- **Pause Buffering Loop / Single-Track Streams**: Pause buffer loop required both audio and video targets via AND, so audio-only / video-only streams never satisfied it and ran to the 3000-packet safety cap (~30s of demux), surfacing as a burst of cache-read spam after pause. Now only checks targets for tracks that exist.
- **A/V Drift Loop on Hardware Burst Decoders**: Hardware decoders that emit 8K frames in bursts queued many future-PTS frames; on >60Hz displays the fallback drained them faster than wall-clock and tripped the audio-desync resync seek loop. Reject frames more than one frame interval ahead of playback time.
- **Audio-less Video in Background Tab**: Without an audio track, the background `processLoop` had no backpressure (video decode skipped, no audio buffer to fill), so the demuxer raced to EOF in seconds. Pause on hide and auto-resume on visible.
- **Volume Keys for Native Audio Sources**: Hotkeys + OSD gated on `getAudioTracks().length` (empty for split video/audio sources). Now also accept `hasNativeAudio()`.
- **Buffered Bar Stability**: Buffered bar is now monotonic between seeks; pause-time buffering no longer pushes past `HttpSource`'s buffered end and trigger a window-resetting refetch.
- **PGS Subtitles On-Canvas**: Image-subtitle overlay was sized in DPR-scaled buffer pixels, pushing the flex-anchored bitmap off-screen on retina. Switched to the canvas's CSS rect (matching the text-subtitle path).
- **Skip A/V Desync Check When Muted**: Demux loop drops audio decode while muted, so `maxScheduledMediaTime` freezes and `getAudioClock()` clamps to a stale value — disabled the 500ms desync detector while muted.
- **No Corrective Seek After Unmute**: Reset the desync cooldown on unmute so the audio clock can catch up first instead of forcing a resync seek (visible as a loading shutter).
- **Progress Handle at 0%**: Dropped the `Math.max(1, …)` floor so the handle sits at 0% at the start instead of jumping in from 1%.
- **Pre-Play Seek**: Re-arm the `seekTargetTime` filter on first-play re-seek so Open-GOP recovery frames (1–2s behind the seek target) get dropped instead of presented; matching drop on resume from pause.
- **`getCurrentPlaybackTime` Frozen When Paused**: `updateActiveSubtitle` called via `setSubtitleCues` during pause can no longer jump to a wall-clock-driven time.
- **PiP Exit Buffer Resize**: Invalidate `_lastCanvasW/H` on PiP exit so the buffer resizes back to host dimensions instead of staying pinned at PiP resolution.
- **Seek OSD Accuracy**: Track the actual delta between the pre-seek time and the clamped target instead of a fixed 10s step. Anchor chained presses on the previous target. Dismiss the OSD on a boundary hit / sub-second / NaN delta.
- **Coalesce Rapid `currentTime` Sets**: Overlapping seeks now collapse into a single tail seek instead of queueing them all.
- **`preventScroll` on Hover Focus**: `focus()` on mouseenter no longer yanks the page when the player is partly off-screen.
- **Subtitle Re-render on Resize via rAF**: Previously a burst per ResizeObserver tick stalled the presentation loop on window drags.
- **Centre Non-VTT Subtitle Lines**: Multi-line SRT cues (e.g. `"- A long line\n- short"`) now sit at the player's centre instead of drifting left.
- **Worker /proxy Probe Failures**: Transient probe errors no longer get misreported as `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

### Documentation
- WebCodecs team outreach playbook (`docs/webcodecs-outreach.md`).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **`postertime` Attribute**: Generate a native-resolution poster from any timestamp without an explicit `poster` URL. Accepts `"10%"`, `"5"`, `"1:30"`, or `"0:01:30"`. Uses an isolated thumbnail pipeline (WASM + `ThumbnailBindings`), respects rotation metadata, and is race-guarded so in-flight generators can't paint stale frames after a `src` change.
- **`dispose()` Method**: Tears down the internal player and resets transient UI (subtitles, timeline, time, title, generated poster) back to the no-source state. Called automatically on every `src` change so playlist-style flows never leak state between sources. Safe to call when nothing is loaded.
- **`playing` Getter**: Read-only boolean that's `true` only while the player is actively playing — distinguishes it from `ready`, `loading`, `seeking`, and `buffering` states (precise inverse of `paused`).
- **`MoviElement.cleanVideoTitle(filename)` Static**: Utility exposed for playlist UIs to derive the same cleaned title the player uses internally — useful for computing the resume localStorage key (`movi-resume:<cleanVideoTitle(name)>`).
- **Folder Playlist (web demo app)**: Sidebar/below-player playlist via File System Access API (with `webkitdirectory` fallback). YouTube-style items with thumbnail, duration, HDR chip, codec/quality/size meta, and watched-progress bar. Lazy thumbnail generation, natural-sort, autoplay-next toggle, drag-and-drop multi-file support.

### Changed
- **`play()` Semantics**: Now queues a play intent during `isLoading` and flushes it from `initializePlayer()`'s finally block — matches `HTMLMediaElement` behavior. Previously bailed silently when called during load.
- **Software Decoder Fallback Per-Source**: Choosing "Try software" no longer sticks across `src` changes. The next video gets a fresh hardware-decode attempt; the `sw` attribute is cleared on dispose.
- **Encrypted Playback Protocol**: `EncryptedHttpSource` rewritten — block prefetch high-water/low-water tuning, concurrent-stream cap, `getPosition()` reports the real read cursor, and parent position field is kept in sync so buffer math stays honest. Encrypted-server ported to match the new protocol.
- **Buffer Tuning**: Runtime tuning of prefetch high-water, refill threshold, and block cache cap via the existing `buffersize` attribute. README/docs corrected to clarify the value is in **megabytes** (not seconds) and applies to both HTTP and encrypted sources.
- **Production Bundles**: Re-enabled terser `drop_console` and `drop_debugger` so release builds ship without dev-only logging.
- **Build Stability**: `app:release` script ties build + R2 upload + worker deploy into a single command. Build version cache-bust scoped to the quoted `__BUILD_VERSION__` literal so unrelated lines aren't rewritten.

### Fixed
- **Post-Seek A/V Sync**: Cap the post-seek audio gap at 200ms — when the first video frame after a seek arrives late (sparse keyframes / slow HEVC+HDR decoders), sync the clock to video time and drop stale audio instead of syncing to the earliest audio packet. Small gaps still prefer audio for continuity.
- **Pre-Play Seek Position**: Scrubbing the timeline before pressing play no longer resets to 0 — the first-play poster-seek now reads `clock.getTime()` instead of a hardcoded start time. Pipeline is flushed on user seek so prebuffered start audio doesn't briefly play before jumping to the target.
- **Fully-Cached Buffered Duration**: Buffered range now reports the full media duration when the file is fully cached, instead of stopping at the last network read.
- **Buffer Indicator Race**: Collapsed the seek-race scan sweep that could draw a phantom buffered range mid-seek.
- **Encrypted Thumbnails**: Share the main source for thumbnail reads instead of opening a parallel session — cuts redundant token churn. Concurrent stream cap prevents seek-storm thrash. Hardened thumbnail read failures (no more fragile retry/cooldown loop).
- **Worker `/proxy` Empty 206**: Retry empty 206 responses from upstream before streaming back, so transient origin hiccups don't surface as broken playback.
- **Worker Probe Failures**: Transient probe errors no longer get misreported as `415 Unsupported Media Type`.
- **TMDb Title Parser**: Detect TV shows when the episode title trails the `SxxExx` code (e.g., `Show.S05E01.Title`).

### Security
- **Worker Referer Allowlist**: `/proxy` and `/eproxy` endpoints now gate requests by Referer to block hotlinking from unauthorized origins.
- **Worker Magic-Byte Validation**: `/proxy` responses are validated against expected media magic bytes before being streamed back, mitigating MIME confusion attacks.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Persistent Preferences**: `stableVolume`, `ambientMode`, and `hdr` toggles now persist via OPFS alongside `volume`, `muted`, and `playbackRate`. User toggles win over HTML attribute defaults on subsequent loads.
- **Split-Source Volume Control**: Volume button now visible when a separate native audio element is loaded, even if the video file has no muxed audio track.
- **Smart Title Extraction**: VLC-style filename cleaning strips release tags, codecs, and quality markers from tab titles. `Content-Disposition` filename used when the server provides one.
- **Chrome Extension**: Local file playback via popup file picker, drag-and-drop onto the player page, and a redesigned popup layout.

### Changed
- **Context Menu**: Slide-panel variant now only used on touch devices (`pointer: coarse`); narrow desktop windows get the regular hover-driven menu.
- **Context Menu Scrolling**: Max-height clamped to player height with subtle scrollbar styling so tall menus stay accessible on short players.
- **Theme Color Cascade**: `themecolor` attribute now flows to `--movi-primary-light` and `--movi-primary-dark` via `color-mix`, so active menu items and highlights follow the custom theme.
- **`title` Attribute**: No longer triggers the browser's native tooltip on hover — title is rendered only by the in-player overlay.
- **Subtitle/Audio Track Menus**: Show language codes alongside track labels for clarity.

### Fixed
- **Short Video Stutter**: Prebuffer media before `ready` so `play()` doesn't immediately stall on short clips.
- **Background Audio at 50/60 fps**: Skip video decode while hidden so audio keeps flowing on high-fps content.
- **Narrow Viewport Controls**: Buttons, gaps, and center play button tightened on viewports ≤ 480px to prevent the controls bar from overflowing the player box on iPhone 12 Pro-class widths.
- **Empty State Placement**: "No Video" placeholder no longer clips into the controls bar on short/narrow players.
- **OSD Speed Icon**: Correct speed icon shown when playback rate changes via hotkeys/context menu.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Ambient Mode**: Dynamic letterbox glow that samples video colors in real-time. Smooth 60fps color transitions via WebGL clearColor. Toggle with `G` key or context menu. Works in fullscreen (letterbox) and normal mode (external wrapper). `ambientmode` attribute.
- **Split Source Support**: Separate video, audio, and subtitle file URLs via `videosrc`, `audiosrc`, `subtitlesrc` attributes.
- **PGS Image Subtitles**: Bitmap subtitle decoding with zlib decompression support.
- **Network Disconnect Recovery**: Intelligent CORS vs transient network failure detection (3-strike threshold). Online-event-aware backoff for instant retry on reconnection. Auto re-seek on recovery. 30s timeout on offline wait.
- **Document Picture-in-Picture**: Floating video window with play/pause, seek, mute, progress bar, time display, keyboard shortcuts, and back-to-tab button. Portrait video sizing. Rotation save/restore on PiP enter/exit.
- **DRM Support**: `drm` and `licenseurl` attributes for HLS streams with Widevine/FairPlay via EME API.
- **HLS Quality Menu**: Duplicate resolutions show bitrate (e.g., "1080p · 5000 kbps").
- **HLS Nerd Stats**: Video codec, resolution, quality, frame rate, bitrate, buffer, HLS level, bandwidth, live latency, frames decoded/dropped.
- **VLC-style Shortcuts**: `V` subtitles, `B` audio, `+/-` speed, `L` loop, `U` stable volume, `H` HDR, `P` PiP, `G` ambient, `A` aspect ratio.
- **Aspect Ratio Controls**: `A` key cycles contain/cover/fill/zoom. Sub-menu with icons in context menu and bottom controls.
- **Stable Volume**: DynamicsCompressorNode for loudness normalization. Opt-in via `stablevolume` attribute.
- **Nerd Stats**: Press `I` for codec, resolution, FPS, decoder type, buffer health, color info, and live network/disk activity graph.
- **Timeline**: Press `T` for auto-generated thumbnail strip with chapter support. Arrow key navigation, click-to-seek.
- **Chapter Support**: Extract chapters from video metadata. Chapter markers on progress bar, chapter titles in seek tooltip.
- **Video Rotation**: Press `R` to rotate 90°. Metadata rotation auto-applied. Disabled during PiP.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Panel**: Press `?` to view all shortcuts.
- **Resume Playback**: `resume` attribute saves position to localStorage with resume/start-over dialog.
- **Encrypted Playback**: AES-256-GCM chunked encryption with HMAC-SHA256 signed requests.
- **Background Audio**: Video keeps playing audio when tab is in background via Web Worker timer fallback.
- **Chrome Extension**: Popup with "Paste & Play" and "Play from Computer", context menu on video links, play button overlay on detected URLs.
- **Privacy Policy**: Published at docs site for Chrome Web Store compliance.

### Changed
- Buffering state now stops presentation loop so frames accumulate for reliable recovery.
- Buffering exit requires video frames ready (with 3s fallback for async decoder delays).
- Pause during buffering allowed from all UI controls (click, keyboard, buttons, PiP, context menu).
- `buffering → ended` state transition allowed for EOF during rebuffer.
- Invalid packet size at EOF treated as EOF (not fatal error) for FFmpeg stale buffer data.
- HDR icon changed to text badge style in OSD and context menu (matches bottom controls).
- Extension description rewritten to remove excessive format keywords (Chrome Web Store compliance).
- Console logs dropped in production build.

### Fixed
- Hardware decoder error recovery with keyframe cache and software fallback.
- Seek and play/pause during buffering state.
- Network disconnect causing permanent CORS misclassification when `navigator.onLine` lags.
- Stale stream loops from leaked online event listeners during backoff.
- Multiple concurrent fetch loops after network recovery.
- Clock advancing during buffering (presentation loop consuming frames).
- PiP rotation clipping — rotation reset on PiP enter, restored on close.
- PiP portrait video oversized — height-limited sizing for portrait aspect ratios.
- Pause-seek loading stuck — `VideoDecoder.flush()` 1s timeout with reset+reconfigure fallback.
- EOF not triggering — relaxed condition with 0.5s tolerance.
- PiP canvas restore using `shadowRoot` directly.
- PiP frame freeze on tab switch with `isPiPActive` guard.
